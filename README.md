# ML Internship Projects at Bharat Intern

## About
I completed a 1-month virtual internship at Bharat Intern, where I worked on two exciting projects: Iris Flower Classification and Movies Recommendation System.

## Projects
### Iris Flower Classification
- Implemented logistic regression, decision tree classifier, and support vector machine algorithms.
- Achieved impressive accuracies: logistic regression (100%), decision tree classifier (96.66%), support vector machine (100%).
- Utilized numpy, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and sklearn libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and algorithm implementation.

### Movies Recommendation System
- Developed a recommendation system using Bag of Words for text vectorization and cosine similarity measure for recommendation.
- Recommended five movies based on user preferences.
- Employed pandas, numpy, ast module, sklearn, and NLTK for data processing and analysis.
